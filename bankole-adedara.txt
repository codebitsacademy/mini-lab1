Q: What is the difference between an inline element and a block element
A: By default, block level elements take up the entire width of it's parent container. 
After it's reached the edge of the container it'll drop below the other elements. 
So if you've just got a paragraph in the <body> then it will take up the entire with of the browser, 
unless you've set a width for the body. So, that means that even if you've got short sentences in separate paragraph tags, 
each paragraph will start on a new line. A few of the most 
common block level elements are:
<h1>, <p>, <div>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <nav>, and <header>. 
On the other hand, inline elements don't start on new lines, meaning that they'll line up right next to each other on the same line if there's enough room for them.


Q: What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
A: An element with "position: absolute" is removed from the normal document flow. 
It is positioned automatically to the starting point (top-left corner) of its parent element. 
If it doesn't have any parent elements, then the initial document <html> will be its parent.

Q: How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
A: Putting an inline element inside a block element

In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
The concept of the CSS box model is that all HTML elements can be considered as boxes. 
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: margin, which is the space between the box itself and its closest elements;
borders, which are the four edges of the box and; padding, which is the space between the content and the border and the actual content.

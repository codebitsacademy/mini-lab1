1)	Difference betweence Inline and Block Element

An inline element does not cause a line break (start on a new line) and does not take up the full 
width of a page, only the space bounded by its opening and closing tag. It is usually used within 
other HTML elements e.g anchor tag, emphasis tag and image tag while a block-level element always 
starts on a new line and takes up the full width of a page, from left to right. A block-level 
element can take up one line or multiple lines and has a line break before and after the element e.g
div,List, heading tags.

2) When an element is position absolute, it is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
(instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed)

3)display:inline;

4) Inline Elements
	span element <span>
	anchor tag <a>
	emphasis tag <em>
	button <button>
	input <input>

   Block elements
	div element <div>
	List e.g ordered and unordered list
	heading tags e.g from h1 to h6
	paragraph elements <p>
	

   Inline block
	image tag <img>

 Box model 
	An HTML element is divided into 4 parts which forms the box model of the HTML, these are
		1-Content
		2-Padding
		3-Border
		4-Marging
The content is the the content area of the HTML, it is the area whwere the contents are enveloped.
The Padding is the area the covers (rounds) the content arra, it is transparent in nature
The border is the the one the wraps the content and the padding,it is formed after the padding of an html element
The marging is the space that wraps the outside of the border, it is also transparent in nature.

The Fix to Box model is 
	box-sizing: border-box
